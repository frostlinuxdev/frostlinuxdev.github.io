### Side hint not a bad idea to set all Steam Games to your Proton-GE or Proton-CachyOS 
If you need to use a specific one or even a  different one can always set that per game

### Set  default to use Proton-GE Latest in Compatbility
Now every game on Steam will use Proton-GE by default no more setup.
